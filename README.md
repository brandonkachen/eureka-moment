  Eureka Moment
</h1>

Website: <a href="https://eureka-moment.web.app/" target="_blank">Eureka Moment</a>. Written in React using GatsbyJS and Bulma CSS, hosted on Firebase.

This was a short experiment in building an online C++ "textbook". The idea was for students to learn C++ by writing small apps in the language, tackling new concepts as they progressed. I developed lessons that built upon one another, naturally surfacing a new topic after the student discovered a need for it. 

For example, lesson 3 teaches students how to build a multi-dimensional array. As the student becomes familiar with this concept, they discover what pointers are and how they enable multi-dimensional arrays to work. I had a mentee (primary user) who was unable to continue beyond the third lesson, but this project taught me a lot about the work that goes into making a textbook.
