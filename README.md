This was a short experiment in building an online C++ "textbook". The idea was for students to learn C++ by writing small apps in the language, tackling new concepts as they progressed. I developed lessons that built upon one another, naturally surfacing a new topic after the student discovered a need for it. For example, lesson 3 teaches students how to build a multi-dimensional array. As the student becomes familiar with this concept, they discover what pointers are and how they enable multi-dimensional arrays to work. I had a mentee (primary user) who was unable to continue beyond the third lesson, but this project taught me a lot about the work that goes into making a textbook.

## Requirements

- React
- Gatsby
- Bulma

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone the repo**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/godith0/eureka-moment.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd eureka-moment/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `eureka-moment` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
