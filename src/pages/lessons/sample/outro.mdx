# Summary

This section is focused on summarizing the current lesson, but at a high level.
_It will also serve double duty as the recap for the next lesson._

These are the topics we covered this time:

- If-else statements
- For-loops

_We will not allow collapsing for this list,_
_as we want the student to read through everything._

# Review

This section will allow for the student to review a few key questions,
so they can check against their knowledge.

Answer the following questions:

1. What does the syntax for for-loops look like?
2. When do we use if-else statements?

# Challenge

This section will contain a challenge to the student, to use the
knowledge they just acquired to modify the program in an
interesting way.

What will this program do? Why?

```cpp
std::string user_action;
std::cout << "Type an attack: "; // Type an attack and press enter
std::cin >> user_action;
while (true) {
  std:cout << "what will I do?" << std:endl;
}
```
