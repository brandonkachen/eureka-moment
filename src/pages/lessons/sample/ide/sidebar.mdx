# Plan

This section will explain the high-level plan for this lesson.
At every step, we will guide the student to learn through discovery,
build upon their knowledge through scaffolding, and test their understanding
through complex scenarios that grow from the basics they have learned.

## New Feature: Allow the user to choose an attack mechanism.

Let's add a new feature that allows the user to choose from
these three attacks:

- Thunder Shock
- Wild Charge
- Discharge

(Side Quest: build these attacks out yourself!)

## Where should we divert the logic in the program, so we can execute the user's action?

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  /* An annoying "Hello World" example */
  for (auto i = 0; i < 0xFFFF; i++)
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;

  char c = '\\n';
  unordered_map <string, vector<string> > m;
  m["key"] = "\\\\"; // this is an error

  return -2e3 + 12l;
}
```

Put a comment indicating where you'd make this change in the code editor on the right.

## Fill in the blank:

{If} the user chooses 'Thunder Shock', we'll execute 'Thunder Shock'.

{Otherwise}, if the user chooses 'Wild Charge', we'll execute 'Wild Charge'.

{Else}, we'll execute 'Discharge'.

## This is what we call an if-else statement. The C++ syntax for it is:

```cpp
string user_action;

// Type an attack and press enter
std::cout << "Type an attack: ";
std::cin >> user_action;
if (user_action == "Thunder_Shock") {
  // code to handle "Thunder_Shock"
  // attack goes here
}
```
