# Level 3: Classes, pt. 1 üìö

This level will introduce you to C++ classes and structs. We'll discover _why_ they are useful
and how they work internally. C++ was originally called "C with Classes", because classes were the
major innovation C++ brought to the table. Let's see what the hype is about! üßê

On the next screen, you'll find instructions and explanations
on the left-hand panel as you build your program.
It is scrollable, so make sure you get to the bottom before continuing on.
The right-hand panel contains your coding environment
(a "[repl](https://docs.repl.it/)").
You can hit the "run" button at the top right to compile and run your program.
