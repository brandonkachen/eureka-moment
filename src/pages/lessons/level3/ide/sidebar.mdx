# Level 3

Navigate to the `main.cpp` file in your repl. Your code will go there.

## Task 1: Create an item

Items have a few attributes:

- name (string)
- description (string)
- effect (string)
- rarity (int)

Let's go ahead and create these attributes to describe one item.
Its name will be "health_potion", description will be "heals the player",
effect will be "+ 10 hp", and rarity will be "2".

**Task:** Fill out the empty strings in Task 1. We now have all the attributes
of a health potion item!

## Task 2: Create some more items

Ok, great. Let's create 3 more health items, manually. We'll prefix their attributes
with `item2_` and `item3_`, respectively.

**Task**: Create 3 more health potions in this manner.

## Task 3: Adding a new attribute

Ok, sorry you had to go through that. Kind of painful, isn't it?
Well I've got some more bad news for you, the bossman wants us to
add a new attribute to each item: "timer". This is an `int` that determines
how many turns the player can hold this item for. Once elapsed, it will destroy
the object.

**Task:** Go back to each item you've created in the previous tasks and
add a "timer" attribute with a value of 3.

## Task 4: A better way

This... isn't a scalable solution, is it? We've barely created 3 health potions
and yet we've written nearly the same code 3 times! What's worse, adding a new
attribute to them means we need to add a new line of code for each item.

The worst part is that in this program, the number of lines of code
will grow _linearly_ to the number of items we create. That will be a nightmare
to maintain, and fixing typos will be a full-time job!

No, there has to be a better way... introducing C++ **structs**! Not classes,
as you may have thought. Structs are a bit easier to explain, so we'll use them
to help us better understand classes later. Once you understand structs,
it'll take you a second to understand classes. ðŸ˜Š

Structs allow us to repackage functionality that should belong to some objects (in this case,
our items) and easily create multiple copies of them. Here's the basic syntax:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  int fn(int ret) {return ret;}
};
```

The code above defines a struct called `NameOfStruct`. It has two **member variables**:

1. an int called `attribute1`
2. a string called `attribute2`

It also has a **member function** called `fn` that takes in integer parameter called `ret`
and returns it.

**Task:** Create a struct called `HealthPotion`. Add the attributes described in Task 1
as members.

## Task 5: Creating an instance

Now, let's use this struct. We can call it with the same syntax as any of our fundamental types.
Followng the sample code above, we can write:

```cpp
NameOfStruct obj;
```

Simple, nice! We can access its members like this:

```cpp
obj.attribute1; // calls this member, but does nothing with it

std::cout << obj.attribute2 << std::endl; // prints: "test"

int val = obj.fn(42); // struct member functions are called like this
std::cout << val << std::endl; // prints: 42
```

**Task:** Create a `HealthPotion` object, called hp1, and print out its "name" member.

## Task 6: Creating 100 HealthPotions _easily_

This is great! Let's can create a bunch of HealhPotion objects and store them
in an array, just like we'd do for other objects we want to keep track of.
Now if we wanted to create a different number of health potions instead,
it's as simple as changing one variable. Just like our fundamental types, we can
simply declare an array of our struct type:

```cpp
NameOfStruct arr0[10];

// Notice the how similar arr0 looks to other arrays:
int arr1[10];
```

**Task**: Create an array of 100 health potions. Then, update your code to create and hold
1,000 health potions.

## Task 7: Constructors

We're going to be setting our member variables pretty frequently, like this:

```c++
NameOfStruct obj;

obj.attribute1 = 0;
```

It can get annoying to do this everywhere in our code. Instead, we'll use C++ **constructors** to
save us some code! (They're also useful for more than this, but we'll get to that later.)
A constructor is a special function that lives in structs and is responsible for setting it up.
This setup process is called **initialization**. Here's what a C++ constructor looks like:

```cpp
struct StructWithConstructor {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";

  // Constructor
  StructWithConstructor(int att1) {
    attribute1 = att1;
  }
};
```

Notice that its name is equivalent to the _struct_'s name (`StructWithConstructor`). This is our
telltale sign that the function is a constructor. You can pass in arguments to it, just like any
normal function. In our case, we pass in one parameter called `att1` and the constructor sets the
`attribute1` member to it.

In our example above, we declared constructor last. We did this because C++ executes our code
in the order it reads them, so `attribute1` is initialized first, then `attribute2`, etc.
If the constructor was initialized first, C++ would complain because it wouldn't know about
`attribute1` yet. By putting the constructor after all the member variables, we can make sure C++
knows about them before accessing them.

When we create this object, we'll have to pass in an argument:

```cpp
int main() {
  StructWithConstructor obj(10); // 10 is sent to `att1` argument
  std::cout << obj.attribute1 << std::endl; // prints: 10
}
```

This looks kind of like calling a function, doesn't it? That's not an accident; you can think
of a constructor as a member function that is called just once, when the object is
initialized.

**Task**: Add a constructor for `HealthPotion` that lets you set the `effect`, as described
in Task 1. Don't forget to update all your `HealthPotion` objects so they pass in an argument
for the `effect` member. Then, create two different health potions through object instantiation,
one that heals the player by 10 points and another that only heals them by 5 points.
Call them "hp10" and "hp5", respectively.

## Task 8: Initial timer functionality

Let's implement the timer's functionality. To do so, we'll need to know how many
turns have elapsed since the player has acquired the timer. In the repl, you'll
see some unfinished code with a `turn` variable simulating turns passing by. This will
tell us how many turns have passed.

**Task**: Add some code to decrement `hp`'s timer. When it hits 0, output:
"Health Potion has expired."

## Task 9: Destructors

Unfortunately, our `HealthPotion` object is still alive and kicking after it was expired.
Now we need to actually remove it from the program's memory, so your computer can re-use it
for something else. This process is also called **freeing** the memory. C++ can automatically
do this for us. What's more, when it performs this operation, it lets us optionally do some
last-minute operations before freeing the object!

C++ does this through another special method called the **destructor**. Like the constructor, it
exists in every class but does nothing unless you implement it yourself. It is responsible for
handling deletion events you want your object to perform before it gets deleted. Here's the
syntax for the destructor:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";

  // Constructor
  NameOfStruct(int att1) {
    attribute1 = att1;
  }

  // Destructor
  ~NameOfStruct() {
    std::cout << "nooo i'm going awayyy" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "i can still access my attributes; "
              << "attribute1: " << attribute1;
  }
};
```

Pretty similar to the constructor, right? The constructor and destructor are two sides
of the same coin. The constructor is like a starting up a phone, while the destructor
is like shutting it down. Together, they help us manage the **lifecycle** of an object,
or what to do with it at any given point in time that the object exists in the program.

Notice that the destructor doesn't take in any arguments, as it only handles the object itself.
It can still access all the members within the object (because the object is still in memory).
It is a great place for us to output the expired health potion's message that you printed in the
previous task.

**Task:** Let's move it to the destructor and add a call to `delete` the object when the timer ends.

## Task 10: Intro to Memory Allocation/Deallocation

As we informally explained above, the process of storing into computer memory is called
memory **allocation**. Of course, computers have finite memory, so at some point it needs
to overwrite some parts of memory in order continue to work. The process of "releasing"
memory back to the operating system is called memory **deallocation**.

So far, we haven't directly allocated or deallocated anything in our code, so what gives?
Even the destructor in the example code and task above didn't actually explicitly free any memory.

It turns out that C++ hides the magic from us, through a process called **automatic** memory
allocation. When we create a variable, C++ helps us out by allocating memory for us, and managing
it. Once all the code that uses this variable has finished running, C++ will disallow us from
accessing it again and clean this for us.

How does C++ know when we're done with a variable? We implicitly tell it, through our program
structure! Take a look at the following:

```cpp
int add_zero(int i) {
  int j = i + 0;
  return j;
}

int main() {
  int val1 = 1;
  int val2 = add_zero(val1);
  return val2;
}
```

This is what happens to memory at every step of the program:

1. Execute the `main` function, allocating memory for the variable `var1`.
2. Call `add_zero`. At this point, we note that we're going into a new function.
3. Allocate more memory for the parameter `i`.
4. Execute the code in `add_zero`. We need to allocate memory for the variable `j`.
5. Return back to `main`. Upon exiting from `add_zero`, we mark `i` and `j` as invalid to
   access and allow the memory associated with it to be freed.
6. Allocate more memory to store the returned value into `val2`.
7. Return `val2` to whomever ran this program. Upon exiting from `main` we mark `val1` and
   `val2` as invalid and allow the memory associated with it to be freed.

In this simple program, C++ frees memory whenever it exits a function. C++ may free memory
at other points in a function. For example:

```cpp
int func() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    int j = i + 1;
    std::cout << j << std::endl;
  } // deallocate `i`

  int u = 0;
  u += 1;
  return u;
} // deallocate `u`
```

Notice how we only care about `i` while executing the for loop. Well, why not free memory at
that point? C++ does exactly that, even though we haven't left `func` when we allocate memory
for the variable `u`. Later, when we we return from `func`, C++ will automatically deallocate `u`.
Another way to say this is that we've left the **scope** of our variable `i`, but not the scope of
our variable `u`. Scope is just a fancy term for the point a variable is allocated and deallocated.

**Task**: Write out the full steps C++ will take when running `func` in the previous example.
Use the steps for the example before it as a guide. Add a comment noting where each of the scopes
for `i`, `j`, and `u` begin and end.

## Task 11: Dynamic Memory Allocation

Now that we've got an understanding of what C++ does for us, let's look at a case where
we need to _manually_ free memory. We normally create variables like this:

```cpp
int p = 25;
```

This is fine, but here's a different way to accomplish the same thing:

```
int *p = new int(25);
```

There's our good friend the pointer again! This code initializes a pointer
to the value 25 that has first been type-casted as an int. Later when you use `p`, you're
implicitly following the pointer to the underlying value, 25.

Did you notice the `new` **operator** in the code above? Operators are keywords that are
built into C++ that give us specific functionality, like "=" or "+". C++ knows
to differentiate these symbols from other characters so it do things we expect like setting
equality or performing addition.

The `new` operator is how we _manually_ allocate memory in C++. How do we manually _deallocate_
memory, then? Well, we simply run the following code:

```cpp
delete obj;
```

When C++ runs this line of code, it will call `obj`'s destructor and free the memory.
If we forgot to run that code, we'd get in a **memory leak**, where your program indefinitely
sits on a piece of memory it isn't using.

For a short program running on modern hardware, a memory leak is not a big deal. However,
systems that run for days and weeks on end (like servers and ATMs) cannot afford memory leaks
because the leaks are likely to increase over time as the program continues to run.
If your program tries to allocate more memory than it is allowed, you'd better hope your OS
forcibly terminates it. If not, your program may cause the entire computer to crash!

Why would you ever use `new` and `delete` instead of just letting C++ take care of the memory?
We'll show an example later where this is useful, but the short answer is whenever you as the
programmer want direct control over your C++ objects. For example, you may be writing a very
memory-intensive game, in which every little object should be cleared from memory the moment
it is no longer needed.

In general though, manual control should be a rare occurrence. You should always weigh the
benefit of manual control against the drawback of potential memory leaks.

**Task**: Create a health potion whose memory you control as the programmer. Feel that power!
Buuuuut don't forget to release it right before `main` returns.

## Task 12: Public and Private Members

You know, using the `HealthPotion` struct still requires programmers to know a lot about the
class in order to use it. For example, as a programmer, you have to manually decrement the
timer every single turn. You also need to see how many turns are left and check that after
it reaches 0, the timer is deleted.

Wouldn't it be great to not worry about all of that? In other words, is there a way to set up
our `HealthPotion` struct so that when the player picks one up, it'll just automatically disappear
after 3 turns?

Yes, **private** members can help us accomplish this! By default, struct members are
**public**. This means they can be accessed outside of the struct by other parts of the program.
(They're _publicly_ available to the rest of the program.) This is why the `main()` function
was able to get and set `HealthPotion` members in the previous tasks, like the "timer" or
the "effect" attributes. Private members are the opposite; they can _only_ be used by members
in their own struct. Here's an example to illustrate the point:

```cpp
struct StructWithPrivateMembers {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  void pub_fn() {
    std::cout << attribute1; // outputs: 1
    std::cout << priv_att; // outputs: "this string is private"
  }

  private:
    std::string priv_att = "this string is private";
};

int main() {
  StructWithPrivateMembers obj;
  std::cout << obj.attribute1; // outputs: 1
  obj.pub_fn(); // success
  std::cout << obj.priv_att; // error! `priv_att` is private (from main's perspective)
}
```

How can this help us hide implementation details? Well, now we can put these details
inside private member variable and functions. Of course, the code is still there so they're not
truly hidden. However, programmers can safely ignore `private` members when they are just _using_
your class because they can't use them directly, anyway. Thus, we can do a lot of work in these
private members that others don't have to concern themselves with.

In our `StructWithPrivateMembers` example, we can add a `shouldCleanup()` function that
will help us determine whether or not we're cleared to delete the object. If it returns true,
our `main` function can run `delete` on the object. Otherwise, we'll just ignore it:

```cpp
struct StructWithPrivateMembers {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string shouldCleanup() {
    // can check against any arbitrary condition
    if priv_att == "this string is private":
      priv_att = "delete me";
      return false;
    else:
      return true;
  }

  private:
    std::string priv_att = "this string is private";
}
```

Note that `shouldCleanup()` is a public function. If it wasn't, no one outside the struct
can call it directly. Thus we can do something like this:

```cpp
int main() {
  // don't forget: we don't get explicit control over `obj` unless
  // we create it wth the 'new' keyword.
  StructWithPrivateMembers *obj = new StructWithPrivateMembers;

  int i = 0;
  while (true) {
    std::cout << "loop #" + i << std::endl;

    if obj.shouldCleanup() {
      // only allowed to exit if we delete `obj`
      delete obj;
      break;
    }

    i++;
  }
}
```

Because `obj.shouldCleanup()` is called twice, the output of our program above will be:

```
loop #0
loop #1
```

Initially `shouldCleanup()` returned false since the if condition was met. However, the
function returned true the second time it ran because the if condition wasn't met.

Just to be explicit, we can add the "public" keyword for the other members but this step is
optional because struct members are defaulted to public:

```cpp
struct StructWithPrivateMembers {
  public:
    int attribute1 = 1;
    std::string shouldCleanup() {
      // ...
    }

  private:
    std::string priv_att = "this string is private";
}
```

Remember the constructor we talked about earlier? Since it is a function, it can set member
variables like `shouldCleanup`, even private ones. The same goes for the destructor. It is
common for programmers to set private member variables at object initialization using the
constructor, even if they can never modify them again.

As your programs get more complex, private struct members may be useful to "hide" some of the
functionality from the rest of your code. This will help simplify what other programmers need
to know in order to use your structs.

**Task**: Let's add a similar public member function to `HealthPotion`, also called
`shouldCleanup()`. Its job is to decrement the timer and see if 3 turns have elapsed.
If so, it will return true. It will return false otherwise. Our `main` function can then
call `delete` on it. And while we're at it, let's make the "timer" member variable private
and hide some of the implementation.

## Task 13: Putting it all Together

Implement the following:

1. Create a new `HealthPotion` array that can hold up to 10 at a time.
2. Add 2 potions to it.
3. Take one turn.
4. Add another potion.
5. Take another turn.
6. Add 5 potions.
7. Take another turn. The first two potions should have expired.
8. Take another turn. The third potion should have expired.
9. Take another turn. All the other potions should have expired.

See how easy it is to keep track of all these objects and their attributes?
That's the power of structs!

## Task 14: Intro to classes

We opened this chapter by briefly discussing C++ classes, but we've spent
the vast majority of our time working wtih structs instead. What gives?

Aside from the fun subversion of expectations, the main reason for this
bait-and-switch is because C++ classes and structs are practically identical
in terms of functionality.

The _only_ difference is that C++ classes default
all their members to being _private_, while C++ structs default all their
members to being _public_. This just means that if you forgot to add the
"public" or "private" tag to a member, a class would treat it as private
while a struct would treat it as public.

Going forward, we'll use C++ classes by default rather than structs. The only
time we'll use structs is if we want _all_ members to be public.

**Task**: Duplicate your `HealhPotion` struct and turn it into a class called
`HealthPotionClass`. Then, duplicate your code in the previous task and make
any changes necessary so the functionality stays the same.

If you're curious, the reason for this weirdness is C. C doesn't have classes
(remember, C++ introduced the concept) but it has structs. C's structs are very
limited, but since C++ wanted to stay compatible with C, it had to implement
structs as well. Over time, C++ extended the functionality of structs,
eventually mirroring classes completely. Now, structs are almost vestigial.
