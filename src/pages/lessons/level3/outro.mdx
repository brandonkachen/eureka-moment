# Summary

This level introduced us to C++ Classes, a very powerful idea
that has helped scale and manage large amounts of complexity in
computer programs. Specifically, we saw:

- what exactly makes classes useful
- how they fit into the lifecycle of a programs
- what classes can/can't do well.
- classes vs structs

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What separates private class members from public members?
2. What do constructors do? Destructors?

# Challenge

Can you have an instance of a class inside another class? If not, explain why not.
If so, show an example, with working code.

Additionally, explain why this capability would be useful
_and_ what complexities might arise as a result.
