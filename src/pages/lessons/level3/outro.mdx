# Summary

This level introduced us to C++ classes and structs, very powerful concepts that have
helped computers scale and manage large amounts of complexity. Specifically, we saw:

- what exactly makes classes useful
- class lifecycles
- memory allocation & deallocation
- classes vs structs

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What separates private class members from public members?

<FreeRespComp qid="tvw8" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

2. What do constructors do? Destructors?

<FreeRespComp qid="usv9" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

3. What is statically allocated memory? Dynamically allocated memory? When would you use one
   over the other?

<FreeRespComp qid="vwm2" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

4. What criteria determine the "scope" of a variable? Give an example.

<FreeRespComp qid="wbs0" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

5. In C++, what is the difference between a class and a struct?

<FreeRespComp qid="wcd9" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

# Challenge

Can you have an instance of a class inside another class? If not, explain why not.
If so, show an example, with working code.

<FreeRespComp qid="xad3" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

Explain why the capability in the previous questoin would be useful
_and_ what complexities might arise as a result.

<FreeRespComp qid="ydv5" {...props}></FreeRespComp>
