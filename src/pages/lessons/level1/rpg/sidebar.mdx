## Introduction

Let's get some syntax under our belt,
and then we'll use it to build a mini-rpg.

## Syntax cheatsheet

Here's a little cheatsheet of common syntax you'll find in C++.
There are a ton of similarities to C#, so this should be pretty familiar.
You can see a sample program version that combines all these elements
in the `syntax.cpp` file in your repl (IDE on the right).

### Basics

Single Line comments look like this:

```cpp
// this is a comment
```

Multi-line comments look like this:

```cpp
/*
this is a comment
that spans
multiple lines
*/
```

This is how you import libraries and modules:

```cpp
#include <YOUR-LIBRARY-HERE>
```

Your "main" function looks like this:

```cpp
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

By convention, returning 0 means success and 1 means failure.
Programs running your code may change their behavior depending
on this return code. You can change your main function to "void"
if you don't want to return anything:

```cpp
void main() {
  // do stuff!
  // don't return anything though!
}
```

C++ also has a few fundamental types.
See [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-data-types/)
if you want a quick refresher.

```cpp
// integers
int i = 0;

// floating-point numbers
float f = 0.0;

// double floating point numbers
// (more precise than floats)
double d = 0.0;

// boolean values
bool b = true;

// characters
char c = "x";
```

### Control Flow

This is how you write if/else statements:

```cpp
bool b = false;
int i = 0
int j = 1

if (i == j) {
  b = true;
} else {
  b = false;
}
```

#TODO: loops

### C++ strings

C and C++
Here's one more useful library, for dealing with strings:

```cpp
#include <string>
```

This will let you create and manage C++ strings. You can do operations
like the following:

```cpp

// assign strings
std::string x = "this is a C++ string";

// get their lengths
int length = x.length();

// copy strings
std::string y = x;

// check for equality
bool is_same = (y == x); // true
```

### iostream

When you import the `iostream` library like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

You get access `std` (which stands for **standard library**).
`std` is a _namespace_, which means it contains functions and classes within
it that you can use. One such tool is the ability to write to the console
or read from a user's input:

```cpp
int x;

 // Write to the console
std::cout << "Input a number.";

// cin will cause the program
// to pause and wait for user input.
// By default, the program will continue
// after the user inputs a new line.
std::cin >> x;
```

The funny `<<` and `>>` are called left and right **shift operators**,
respectively. They have their own meanings (that we'll get to later).

If it helps, you can think of these operators as "moving" values
to and from `cin` or `cout`. In other words, when we `cout`, we are
"moving" the right-side values _into_ `cout`, or the console.
So in the previous example:

```cpp
std::string output = "Input a number.";

/*

You can think of the << as a funnel
moving the `output` variable
from right to left to `std::cout`,
because that's where the value will end up

*/
std::cout << output;
```

Similarly, we read from `cin` and "move" the value to a variable:

```cpp
std::string input;

/*

You can think of the >> as a funnel
moving whatever the user inputs to `std::cin`
from left to right, which is the variable `input`.

*/
std::cin >> input;
```

While you can manually input a newline, `std` can do it for you:

```cpp
std::cout << "test" << std::endl;
std::cout << "this will be on the next line";
```

Writing `std::` everywhere may get tiring, so you
can add the following to the top of your program:

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

After this, you can just write `cout` or `cin` without the `std::` prefix.

Just FYI, many programmers actively discourage adding code like the above.
The rationale is that in the future, someone may add another
library that contains functions/classes with the same name as an existing one.
In the case of `std`, someone might add their own `cout` or `cin`.
It could get messy to fix this problem, hence the discouragement.

However, in our lessons, we won't do anything that will mess up
the standard library. You can feel free to use either approach.

## Mini-RPG

Switch to the `mini_rpg.cpp` file in repl.
Read through it quickly to check if you missed anything in
the cheatsheet above. Then try running it. You should
get the following:

```
Welcome, please enter your name:
```

When you enter your name, it will output something like:

```
Welcome, player <YOUR INPUTTED NAME>
```
