# Plan

Let's get some syntax under our belt, and then we'll use it to build a mini-rpg.

## Syntax

Here's a little cheatsheet of common syntax you'll find in C++.
There are a ton of similarities to C#, so this should be pretty familiar.
You can see a sample program version that combines all these elements
in the `syntax.cpp` file in your repl (IDE on the right).

### Basics

Single Line comments look like this:

```cpp
// this is a comment
```

Multi-line comments look like this:

```cpp
/*
this is a comment
that spans
multiple lines
*/
```

This is how you import libraries and modules:

```cpp
#include <YOUR-LIBRARY-HERE>
```

Your "main" function looks like this:

```cpp
int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

By convention, returning 0 means success and 1 means failure.
Programs running your code may change their behavior depending
on this return code. You can change your main function to "void"
if you don't want to return anything:

```cpp
void main() {
  // do stuff!
  // don't return anything though!
}
```

C++ also has a few fundamental types, or _primitives_.
See [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-data-types/)
if you want a quick refresher. Here are some of the most
common ones, _initialized_ to some value:

```cpp
// integers
int i = 0;

// floating-point numbers
float f = 0.0;

// double floating point numbers
// (more precise than floats)
double d = 0.0;

// boolean values
bool b = true;

// characters
char c = "x";
```

In C++, these primitives may be _uninitialized_, or they may
not have some well-known value at compile time. Instead,
they may have a value we don't care about, or a _garbage_ value,
that we can't rely upon.

Sometimes, you may need to convert one type to another.
This is called _type casting_, and you can do it like this:

```cpp
int i = 100;
double j = double(i); // j = 100.0
```

This isn't a perfect process, though. For example, this won't by typecasted cleanly:

```cpp
double k = 1/10;
int l = int(k); // l = 0
```

`l` becomes 0 because when C++ converts `k` to an int,
it applies _integer_ division, which is just regular division but dropping any
remainders to preserve just the integer component.
Thus, 1/10 has 0 whole numbers (and a remainder of 10 that we drop).

If you don't do this conversion explicitly, the C++ compiler will try to do it for you.
This is called _automatic_ type conversion, and it follows a similar logic:

```cpp
int i = 0;
double j = i; // j = 0.0

double k = 0.1;
int l = k; // l = 0
```

When you can convert a type without losing any meaning, it is called "upgrading"
because you've gained precision rather than losing it.

There are many ways you can slice and dice this
(for example, what does type casting an `int` to a `char` mean?).
However, we won't get into it in depth here. You can see
[this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-conversion-in-c/)
for a full breakdown.

### Arithmetic

These are some basic arithmetic operations in C++:

```cpp
int i = 0;
int j = 2;

i = i + j; // addition
i = i - j; // subtraction
i = i * j; // multiplication
i = i / j; // division
i = i ** j; // exponent
```

We can simplify the above like this:

```cpp
i += j; // equivalent to i = i + j
i -= j; // equivalent to i = i - j
i *= j; // equivalent to i = i * j
i /= j; // equivalent to i = i / j

// Note: there isn't a simplification for exponents
```

One thing you'll find that's super common is adding/subtracting
to to/from a variable. Because it's so common, we have another shorthand:

```cpp
i++; // equivalent to i += 1 or i = i + 1
i--; // equivalent to i -= 1 or i = i - 1
```

### C++ strings

C doesn't treat strings in the way you're probably used to working with.
Fortunately, C++ introduced the "modern" way of handing strings
in this library:

```cpp
#include <string>
```

This will let you create and manage C++ strings. You can do operations
like the following:

```cpp

// assign strings
std::string x = "this is a C++ string";

// get their lengths
int length = x.length();

// copy strings
std::string y = x;

// check for equality
if (y == x) {
  // this code should execute
} else {
  // this code should *not* execute
}
```

Unlike all the other fundamental types mentioned earlier,
C++ strings are initialized even when you don't explicitly do so.

```cpp
std::string x = "something"; // set to "something"

std::string x; // set to "" (empty string)
```

### iostream

When you import the `iostream` library like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

You get access `std` (which stands for **standard library**).
`std` is a _namespace_, which means it contains functions and classes within
it that you can use. One such tool is the ability to write to the console
or read from a user's input:

```cpp
int x;

 // Write to the console
std::cout << "Input a number.";

// cin will cause the program
// to pause and wait for user input.
// By default, the program will continue
// after the user inputs a new line.
std::cin >> x;
```

The funny `<<` and `>>` symbols **left and right shift operators**,
respectively. We'll explore them more later but for now you can think
of these operators as "moving" values to and from `cin` or `cout`.
In other words, when we `cout`, we are "moving" the right-side values
_into_ `cout`, or the console:

```cpp
std::string output = "Input a number.";

/*

You can think of the << as a funnel
moving the `output` variable
from right to left to `std::cout`,
because that's where the value will end up

*/
std::cout << output;
```

Similarly, we read from `cin` and "move" the value to a variable:

```cpp
std::string input;

/*

You can think of the >> as a funnel
moving whatever the user inputs to `std::cin`
from left to right, which is the variable `input`.

*/

std::cin >> input;
```

While you can manually input a newline, `std` can do it for you:

```cpp
std::cout << "test" << std::endl;
std::cout << "this will shown on the next line\n";
std::cout << "and this will shown on the line after";
```

You can also split your couts onto different lines, to keep things organized:

```cpp
std::cout << "this will all "
          << "go " << "on " << "one "
          << "line!" << std::endl;
// outputs: "this will all go on one line!"
```

Writing `std::` everywhere may get tiring, so you
can add the following to the top of your program:

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

After this, you can just write `cout` or `cin` without the `std::` prefix.

Just FYI, many programmers actively discourage adding code like the above.
The rationale is that in the future, someone may add another
library that contains functions/classes with the same name as an existing one.
In the case of `std`, someone might add their own `cout` or `cin`.
It could get messy to fix this problem, hence the discouragement.

However, in our lessons, we won't do anything that will mess up
the standard library. You can feel free to use either approach.

### Control Flow

This is how you write if/else statements:

```cpp
bool b = false;
int i = 0
int j = 1

if (i == j) {
  b = true;
} else {
  b = false;
}
```

For loops look like this:

```cpp
int final_value = 10;
int current_value = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < final_value; i++) {
  // Note: the variable `i` exists in
  // this loop, but not outside it
  current_value = i;
}
```

Mean-_while_, while loops like like this:

```cpp
int final_value = 10;
int current_value = 0;

while (current_value < final_value) {
  // Do stuff!
  std::cout << "current_value is: " << current_value << std::endl;
  current_value++;
}
```

Do-while loops are just like while loops,
but execute at least once **before** the
condition is checked. They are formatted like this:

```cpp
int final_value = 10;
int current_value = 0;

do {
  current_value = final_value * 2;

  /*

  This will run once, regardless of
  the condition (in this case, the
  while condition is basically ignored)

  */
} while (current_value < final_value);

std::cout << current_value; // output: 20
```

# Mini-RPG

Switch to the mini-rpg skeleton code. (Hit the "Files" icon
in the repl.it widget on the right and select `mini_rpg.cpp`.)
Read through it quickly to make sure you understand what it will do.
If any part doesn't make senes, review the cheatsheet above.
Then try running it. You should get the following:

```
Welcome, please enter your name:
```

When you enter your name, it will output something like:

```
Welcome, player <YOUR INPUTTED NAME>
```

## Task 0: Taking a looksee

Let's take a quick peek underneath the hood of how our C++ programs are actually run.
Read through the `main.sh` script. This is a **bash** script, which runs commands
directly in a **command line interface** (CLI). This is how you can quickly build
a program to do stuff for you. Think of it as an automated entrypoint into your program.

In this case, our `main.sh` script will do the following:

- **compile** a C++ file (`mini_rpg.cpp`) into a file simply called `mini_rpg`.
- run the `mini_rpg` **binary executable** (note: _not_ `mini_rpg.cpp`)

Let's see this in action! Hit the "run" button at the top of the screen.
You should see a `mini_rpg` file created in the repl file browser
(click the "Files" icon if it's hidden). Now, click on the `mini_rpg` file
to open it. You should see what appears to be gibberish. This isn't gibberish,
but rather the same program in `mini_rpg.cpp` that has just been _converted_
into instructions that are more easily interpreted by the computer. These instructions
are written in **machine language**, which is not very easy for us humans to understand.

This course won't get heavily into the intricate and complex process of _compiling_, or
turning our human-readable code into a list of simple machine instruction for the computer
to execute. If you're curious, check
[this](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/mike/misc/compiling_c++.html) resource out.

Every time you hit the "run" button, a new `mini_rpg` file gets created from (`mini_rpg.cpp`)
that overwrites the existing one.

## Task 1

Let's give our new player a health of 100. Now, let's spawn them
in a specific location. We'll allow the user to choose, like this:

```
Choose a location to spawn. (Enter a number)
1. dungeon
2. cave
3. village
```

When the player has chosen a location, output the following:

```cpp
Player <PLAYER-NAME> has spawned in a <LOCATION-CHOICE>.
```

(where `<PLAYER-NAME>` is the player's name and `<LOCATION-CHOICE>`
is their choice of location).

## Task #2

Great! Let's give your player a few choices for things to do.
Output the following:

```
What would you like to do? (Enter a number)
1. Explore
2. Take inventory.
```

Read the user's input into an _integer_ variable and use it
to determine the next steps.

If the player chose to take inventory, output the following:

```
<PLAYER-NAME> has no items.
```

Then, prompt them with the previous message again.

When the player chooses to explore, perform the following logic:

If the player is in a dungeon, output the following:

```
You encounter a giant spider.
```

If the player is in a village, output the following:

```
You encounter a soldier.
```

If the player is in a cave, output the following:

```
You encounter a bear.
```

On a new line, prompt the user for what they would like to do:

```
What would you like to do? (Enter a number)
1. Talk
2. Fight
3. Cry
```

If the player chose to fight, output the following:

```
You try to fight but have no weapons or skills.
The <spider/soldier/bear> deals you a single blow and you die.
```

If the player chose to talk, make their conversation partner say
something interesting. Make sure to change it depending on the
entity the user is speaking with.

If the player chose to cry, output something funny!

You can output as many lines as you want for either option.

## Task #3

Continue building this mini-rpg out. Some ideas to get you started:

- What can you do with loops?
- Is there functionality that repeats?
  If so, try refactoring it into a function.
- How can you incorporate random numbers?
  See [this guide](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/)
  for help on syntax.

Feel free to be as creative as you like, but note that
you will only be graded on Tasks 1 and 2. When you're finished,
click on the following button.
