# Summary

In this lesson, we explored the basic syntax of C++ for:

- comments
- basic, fundamental types
- control flow (if statements, loops)
- printing to the console
- reading user input
- C++ strings
- and more!

We also used our new knowledge to build a mini-RPG.

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What does the `iostream` library do?
2. Why do we need a `string` library?
3. What does `using namespace std;` do?
4. Why do some programmers recommend _against_ this?

# Challenge

What will the following program do? Why?

```c++
  string user_action;
  std::cout << "Type an attack: "; // Type an attack and press enter
  std::cin >> user_action;
  while (true) {
    std:cout << "what will I do?" << std:endl;
  }
```
