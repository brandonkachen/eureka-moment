# Summary

This section is focused on summarizing the current lesson, but at a high level.
It will also serve double duty as the recap for the next lesson.

These are the topics we covered this time:

- If-statements
- For-loops
- etc...

**We will not allow collapsing for this list, as we want the student to read through everything.**

# Challenge

## This section will contain a challenge to the student, to use the knowledge they just acquired to modify the program in an interesting way.

What will the following program do? Why?

```c++
  string user_action;
  std::cout << "Type an attack: "; // Type an attack and press enter
  std::cin >> user_action;
  while (true) {
    std:cout << "what will I do?" << std:endl;
  }
```
