# Level 1: Welcome! 👋

We'll be exploring computer science concepts through a programming
language called C++. This lesson will bring you up to speed on the basics,
like C++ terminology and syntax. Let's dive right in! 🌊🏄

## Lesson Goals

- Work: Learn the basic syntax of C++
- Fun: Build an RPG

# Let's build an RPG!

On the next screen, you'll find instructions and explanations
on the left-hand panel as you build up your program.
It is scrollable, so make sure you get to the bottom before continuing on.
The right-hand panel contains your coding environment
(a "[repl](https://docs.repl.it/)").
You can hit the "run" button at the top right to compile and run your program.
