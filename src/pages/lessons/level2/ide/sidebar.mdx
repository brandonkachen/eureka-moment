# Game Infrastructure

We're going to implement a simple, popular card game called "Concentration".
It has other names, like "Match Match" or "Memory". See
[here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)>)
for a quick explanation/refresher on how the game works, and
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=492bM_dhdR4) for a video
describing the same game. Note: for simplicity, our version will be
single-player, where the player will try to beat a top score.

## Task 1: Creating our deck

We're going to simulate a standard deck of cards (4 suits, Ace to King, no Jokers).
There are many ways to represent the different cards. Because the most complex operation
we're going to make with these cards is comparing them for equality, we will keep things
simple and use strings to represent them.

<BlankComp qid="auv3" answers={{ e: "order", j: "array" }} {...props}>
  We now need to decide how the deck should work. Decks allow us to `____`[e]
  the cards, so one follows another. This allows us to flip through so we can
  shuffle or deal out the cards. We'll use an `____`[j] to represent the deck in
  our program.
</BlankComp>

To represent our cards, we will append the card value with the suit.
For the card values, we'll use A, J, Q, and K for ace, jack, queen, and king respectively;
1-10 for the rest. For the suit, we'll use D, C, H, S to represent
diamond, club, heart, and spade respectively. Here are some example values:

- `1C`: 1 of Clubs
- `QH`: Queen of Hearts
- `AS`: Ace of Spades.

**Task:** Create a deck that contains all 52 cards.

## Task 2: Set up the gameboard

This game requires spreading out all the cards in a grid, so the player can see
all of them at once. Our array that represents the deck isn't a great choice,
becuase arrays are only good at storing **contiguous** data, or data that is ordered
from beginning to end with no missing pieces anywhere.

This isn't ideal because we need multiple rows to represent the cards. We could keep
track of the index and which row this would correspond with, but that is a bit complicated.
Instead, can't we just have multiple arrays of cards?
Kind of like mini-decks that are all laid out one after another?

Definitely! Let's go ahead and create a few arrays to store the cards, then
loop through each of them to display each row. Let's start small, so we
can more easily catch any bugs in our code before we have too many arrays.

**Task:** Create 4 arrays that hold 3 random cards each, then output them face-up
to the console in order so they represent a game board. Your output should look
like this (but your card values may differ):

```
JC KH 2C
AD 3S QH
7C 10H QS
3H 9S 6D
```

## Task 3: Simplify the gameboard representation

Our arrays are nice, but they can be a bit difficult to manage, especially
if we want to allow the number of cards to be determined by the user at run-time.
Wouldn't it be better if we just had one entity to interact with, like a "super"
array that manages all these arrays?

Well fortuantely, we do have such a tool and it's called a **two-dimensional** array.
It is an array of arrays. That probably sounds a bit confusing, but
you can think of them as a more elegant form of what we did in the previous task:
set up a bunch of arrays and access them. The only difference here is that we store our
arrays inside of a single array, rather than as separate variables. This implies
that our result is a grid, which is exactly what we want in this game.

The syntax for a 2D (integer) array is:

```
int two_d[10][20]; // 10 individual arrays, each size 20 ints.
```

Printing this is a little more challenging than in the previous task, as the
arrays are not just stored in a variable you can directly call. What might
you have to do instead?

**Task**: Re-create the gameboard using a 2D array of type string called `gameBoard`
and print its values. Your output should remain identical to that of the previous task.

## Task 4: Cleanup

### Global variables

In the future, we may allow the user to set the size of the game board when they
start the game. We won't do that task right now because it'll be a fair amount
of work and doesn't advance us forward. For now, we're happy to manually set it
and re-compile the program.

But we make our lives easier by setting the game board size in global variables
that we can reference anywhere in our program. You can find more information
and syntax in `level1`. We should add a global variable that stores the size
our rows, and another for the size of each column.

Beware: C++ may fail to compile if you just declare a variable and use it in an array,
because it is worried you may change this variable later in the program. Since
arrays cannot be re-sized after being created, C++ will get mad at you. We can fix
this easily enough by appending the keyword `const` in front of the variable; this
tells C++ we promise not to change it later (and you'd better believe it'll complain
if we break that promise).

### Invalid game boards

We should note that not all 2D arrays will result in valid game configurations
for us. For example, a 3x3 grid would result in a card with no pair. In this case,
our program should terminate immediately with the following message:

```
Game was not configured in a valid state.
```

How can we check the array to ensure the `gameBoard` configuration is valid?

### Sidenote

While we're here talking about 2D arrays, we should note that we aren't limited to just
two dimensions. Three dimensional arrays are common as well, which are represented as cubes
or rectangular cuboids. There aren't many practical uses to more than 2 or 3 dimensions,
and the computer memory required increases exponentially as you add more dimensions. We
use the term **multi-dimensional arrays** to encapsulate all these types of arrays.

**Task**: Add two global variables, `GAME_ROWS` and `GAME_COLS`, to set the gameBoard's
rows and columns, respectively. Additionally, add the check described above to ensure
the `gameBoard` configuration is valid at runtime.

# Gameplay

Now let's let the user play! We need to implement:

- card state (so the user doesn't see what the card is)
- user input (so the user can match the cards)
- game loop (to advance to the next round)
- player turn counter (to show how many turns the user has taken thus far)
- number of pairs left to match and number of pairs matched (to show player progress)

We'll tackle these in the order presented, because each feature that we implement
will help with the subsequent one.

## Task 5: Card state

Each card can be in 3 different states at any given time:

1. showing (faced up so the user can see the card value and suit)
2. hiding (faced upside down)
3. removed from gameplay

#1 is pretty self-explanatory. It looks like this, for Jack of hearts:

```
JH
```

#2 will look like this:

```
(0,0)
```

where the numbers inside represent the location on the board, like a coordinate plane.
Since the gameboard can be quite large (infinitely large, since it's all virtual!),
we need to make it super easy for the user to point out one card from another
Initially, a 3x3 game will look like this:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)
```

The easiest way to imagine this is to think of the x-y plane, where x grows to the right
and y grows downward.

#3 will look like this:

```
()
```

This occurs when the user selects a matching pair. At that point, we want to remove
the card from gameplay but show the user that it was removed. At the end of a successful
3x3 game, the result will be:

```
() () ()
() () ()
() () ()
() () ()
```

How do we control when a card goes into each state? To make our lives easier, let's create
a separate 2D array that shows the state of the current _game_. In other words, this new
array won't hold any information on the card values themselves, but rather keep track of
what to display to the user at any given time based on the game staet.

**Task**: Implement a 2D array of type int called `gameState` that assigns a state to each card.
The valid values are 1, 2, or 3, depending on the corresponding state explained above.
Then to test your array, loop through `gameState` and print out what the user should see.

## Task 6: User Input

Unfortunately, allowing the user to click on the card itself is beyond
the scope of this course so our solution will need to be a little clunkier.

Since we know how to read in the user input via `std::cin`, let's have them
pass in pairs of coordinates that inform us of the cards they want to flip over.

For example, in a 3x3 game, we output the following at the beginning:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

The user must then respond with a coordinate like this (with parentheses):

```
(0,2)
```

Next, we'll output:

```
(0,0) (0,1) 4S
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the second card:
```

When the user enters this second coordinate, we need to edit the `gameState`
board. First, check the `gameBoard` array for a match between these coordinates.
If there is a match, edit your `gameState` array to set _both_ cards to state #3.
Otherwise, set both cards back to state #2.

If you're unfamiliar with how to clear the terminal screen (so we can redraw
the board and move the game forward), here's a handy function for you:

```c++
std::system("clear");

// we're on a clear screen now
std::cout << "Empty Screen!";
```

**Task**: Implement the above example. Make sure to change the state of your
`gameState` array so it displays the proper view to the user at any given time.

## Task 7: Game loop

Now, let's put in the basics for the full gameplay. This may sound daunting,
but it's actually quite simple.

Let's step back for a second. If we've already got one turn down, what do we
need to do to ensure we continue to the next turn? Well, we've already got our
`gameBoard` and `gameState` arrays set up for the next turn so those don't need
to change. Neither does the view we present to the player, because that is only
dependent on the previous two arrays.

<BlankComp qid="bri9" answers={{ e: "run", k: "forever" }} {...props}>
  Seems like we just need to `____`[e] the same code above again. We don't just
  want to do this once, though, right? After all, this game could last `____`[k]
  (poor player!) if the player doesn't match any pairs.
</BlankComp>

This means we need an infinite loop. Typically those are bad because it means your
program is spinning out of control, but in this case, we are keeping tight control
over it so we're ok. You can create an infinite loop in many ways; the key criteria
is that the evaluation condition is never satisfied.

Of course, we eventually need to terminate this loop if the user completes the game.
To do this, we can add a simple `break;` statement when the winning conditions are met.
We will do this in the later steps. For now, just exit out of the program when you test
or write an arbitrary condition to `break` out of the infinite loop yourself.

**Task**: Create two infinite loops, with different evaluation conditions. Comment
one out and apply the other to the code you wrote in the previous task.

## Task 8: Player turn counter

Now that we have a functional game, we want to keep track of some metrics. Our first
metric is the number of turns the player has taken. This is basically the player's score;
the lower the more impressive. A turn is complete when we've taken two inputs from the user
and checked against `gameBoard`.

At any point in the game, the user should see the number of turns taken.
It should look like this:

```
Turns taken: 8

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

At the end of the game, output the following statement:

```
Congratulations, you've completed the game!
You took x turns in total.
```

where `x` will tell the user how many turns they took.

**Task**: Add an integer called `playerTurns` to count the number of turns the player
has taken and the end-of-game outputdescribed above.

## Task 9: Pairs matched and left to match

To help the player easily gauge how far into the game they've reached, we need to
tell them how many pairs they've matched and how many they have left to match.
At any point in the game, the user should see these two counts. It should look like this:

```
Turns taken: 8. Pairs matched: 2. Pairs remaining: 4.

(0,0) () (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
() (2,1) ()
(3,0) (3,1) ()

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

<BlankComp qid="csq8" answers={{ d: "calculate" }} {...props}>
  Let's use a simple variable to track the number of pairs matched. We'll update
  it every time the player makes a match Note: we won't explicitly track the
  pairs left because we can `____`[d] that from the pairs matched.
</BlankComp>

(Bonus: what is another way we can accomplish this task?)

**Task**: Add an integer called `pairsMatched` to track the number of pairs matched
by the user. Add text to show the number of pairs matched and left to match, as shown
in the example above.

## Task 10: Refactor Prep

Why mess with a working program? Sometimes we need to **refactor** it, or change the code
without changing the functionality. This is an opportunity to organize the code in a better way,
for yourself and future developers. In our case, the program is fairly simple but can benefit
from abstracting some of the details into functions. Let's first preserve our progress and
set up a new environment for the refactor work.

**Task**: To keep your currently-functional code separate from our refactoring work,
duplicate your `game.cpp` and rename it `refactored_game.cpp`. For all future tasks,
use the newly created file. Additionally, edit the `main.sh` script to compile and run
`refactored_game.cpp` rather than `game.cpp` by replacing all instances of the latter
with the former.

## Task 11: Refactor

As we mentioned earlier, refactoring means abstracting parts of the program. What that really
means is that we want to move pieces of code away from the main body of the program (in
our case, the `int main()` function). To do this, we ask two important questions:

1. Which parts of the code are naturally isolated from the rest, or should be?
2. What does the rest of the program really need to know about a certain feature?

Q1 helps us identify components and sub-components of code. This allows us to
break our program into its most natural pieces.

Q2 helps us think from the perspective of a manager of employees at a company:
what is the least amount of detail I need in order to get the job done? A manager needs to
know enough about what's going on to do their job properly, but not too much that they get
buried in the nitty gritty.

Applying these two questions to this program, we've come to a very clear candidate
for refactoring: displaying the gameBoard. This functionality is pretty separate from
the other aspects like editing the game state (Q1) and our game loop code would be cleaner
if it could just call this function anytime it wants to display the current game
view to the user, rather than worry about the steps required to display it (Q2).

Let's refactor the display functionality! Here's some initial code to get you started.
First, you'll need to create a separate function outside the `int main()` code:

```c++
// put this code outside the main() function
void display(
  int gb[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS],
  int gs[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS]) {
  // you can access the array `gb` here like you
  // normally would, e.g. gb[0][0] or gs[2][1]
}
```

This function will handle showing the right view to the user. And this is how you call it:

```c++
int main() {
  // somewhere in the program
  display(gameBoard, gameState);
}
```

**Task**: Create a void function outside of `int main()` called `display` that
takes in a parameter called `arr` that represents the game board and prints out
the state of the game to the console. Then, have your program call it whenever
it needs to display the game state. The game's functionality should not change.

## Task 12: Intro to Pointers

Say, have you ever printed out an array variable directly? If you run the following
code inside the `display(...)` function:

```c++
std::cout << gb << std::endl;
std::cout << gs << std::endl;
```

you should see something like:

```
0x28f4eeaf3fa0
0x7ffed2f23fb0
```

Strange! What does this mean? We're glad you asked. (Well, technically, we
asked on your behalf.)

These are **memory addresses**, or a location in computer memory. They're kind
of like street addresses that tell you about a location in the real world, only
memory addresses tell you about locations in your computer memory. In our case,
these values are the memory locations of the first element of each array. So that
means `gb` is the address for the value `gb[0][0]`.

Well that's weird, why would C++ do that? My my my, you've just opened Pandora's box.
(And by you, we again mean us asking on your behalf.) To get to the heart of this question,
we need to introduce the C++ **pointer**. This is one of the coolest, most dangerous,
and most unique ideas of C and C++. Let's tread carefully.

Pointers get their name from the fact that they "point" to your data in memory.
Think of them as tiny maps or breadcrumbs for your program. In the real world, you
can follow a map to find a house. When you have a pointer, you can "follow" it to get to
the underlying piece of memory and read those values. This process is called **dereferencing**.

That means in our code above, we weren't really copying the entire array into the
`display` function when we passed it as a parameter. We were actually copying a
_pointer_, which is very small in comparison. If we access `gb[0][0]`, C++ dereferences
the pointer and gets the array value underneath.

This has huge implications for performance. Pointers are one of the key reasons for
C and C++'s legendary speed because they're used _everywhere_. Now, we can reach objects
of any size just as quickly as we can reach an int!

Alas, this capability is a double-edged sword. While it unlocks high performance, this
comes at the cost of potential instability. For the sake of speed (remember: a core
competency of C and C++), C++ purposely won't check pointers for validity before
following them. If we're not careful, pointers could lead us to incorrect values or worse,
null values. If you try to access a pointer to a null object, your program will experience
**undefined behavior**. This means the C++ standard doesn't explicitly define what the program
should do, so it's up to your compiler. Compilers can do anything they want, like reading
**garbage values** (a fancy way of saying useless data) or crash the program if they wanted to.
The key is that, as the programmer, you don't know how your program will behave when compiled by
an arbitrary compiler.

To extend our maps/breadcrumbs analogy, if we're not careful, pointers could lead us to the witch's cottage. 😬

**Task**: Print out the pointer values for `gb` and `gs`. You should see values like the ones above,
but they likely won't be the exact same. That's because your computer system is using its memory
differently from ours when we ran that code.

## Task 12: Pointers in practice

Now that we've got an initial theoretical understanding of pointers, let's see how they work
in real C++ code. We will start with a dummy example before dissecting the the `display(...)`
function, because 2D arrays are a bit more complex.

### Basics

First thing's first: a pointer is represented with a pointer _type_ and a **star** (`*`)
operator, like this:

```c++
// a pointer of type `int`,
// pointing to nothing
int* p = NULL;
```

Because pointers are memory addresses, when you set a pointer equal to something,
you can't just set it to some variable or data value. Using our street address analogy from the
previous task, that'd be like giving directions to someone by handing them pieces of the house they're
trying to find! It just makes no sense.

Instead, you need to get the memory address itself. You can do this with the handy **reference**
operator: `&`. Here's an example:

```c++
int* p = NULL;

int i = 0; // normal variable declaration
p = &i; // get i's memory address, not its value

```

When we set pointers, we need to be careful to ensure that their type match their value's type.
For example, integer pointers should only point to integer values, float pointers to float values, etc:

```c++
int i = 0;
int* ip = &i;

float f = 0;
float* fp = &f;
```

Similarly to primitive type conversion, if you have a mismatch, C++ will try to implicitly
convert your pointer type to match. This usually works ok in practice, but it's better to
control this as the programmer if possible.

### Arrays

Arrays in C++ are a bit of a special beast. Because they're used so often and can grow very large,
C++ wants to make them as performant as possible. As a result, it treats arrays as pointers
to the first item. That means:

```c++
int arr[] = { 10, 23, 1, 63 };

std::cout << arr; // prints out a memory address

// When we dereference the pointer,
// we get the first element of the array
std::cout << *arr; // prints out "10"
```

This is a pretty interesting way to interpret the concept of arrays. It means that when you
access another array element:

```c++
int arr[] = { 10, 23, 1, 63 };
std::cout << arr[2]; // prints out "1"
```

C++ is _actually_ performing the following steps:

1. getting the memory address of the first element
2. calculating how far to read past it to reach the correct index specified
3. jumping to a memory address
4. printing out the underlying integer value it finds there

This is what the process looks like, as C++ code:

```c++
// 1.
int* p = arr; // get `arr`

// 2.
int* q = p + 2; // shift to the right array index

// 3.
int r = *q; // dereference to get the value

// 4.
std::cout << r; // print it out
```

Betcha won't ever look at arrays in the same way again!

### 2D arrays

Let's look at our `display(...)` function again. Here is the initial template code, as a refresher:

```c++
// put this code outside the main() function
void display(
  int gb[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS],
  int gs[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS]) {
  // you can access the array `gb` here like you
  // normally would, e.g. gb[0][0] or gs[2][1]
}

int main() {
  // somewhere in the program
  display(gameBoard, gameState);
}
```

Armed with our new knowledge, we know that the code above calls the `display(...)` function
and passes in a pointer to the `gameBoard` and `gameState` arrays. As we discussed at the
beginning of this level, 2D arrays are arrays containing an array.

That means when we access an element like `gb[1][0]`, we follow the steps outlined above
in the `Arrays` section but do it twice. On our first iteration, we get `gb[1]`, which is
actually the memory address for the second array. Then, we treat this like a normal array and repeat
our steps to get to the underlying value.

Multi-dimensional arrays work in the same way, but obviously require as many iterations
as there are dimensions.

**Task**: Add a comment that steps through the entire process that your program
goes through when the following code runs inside the `display(...)` function:

```c++
std::cout << gb[1][0];
```

## Task 13: New primitives

The code above looks great! While we're here, let's make a few easy changes to
make our program a bit lighter on memory and more reasonable. For one thing, we don't
reasonably expect the game to contain a huge number of player turns, pairs matched,
or pairs left to match. Our card coordinates also shouldn't exceed a huge number.

Well, the `int` primitive we've been using can store values between -2,147,483,648
and 2,147,483,647. That's way more than we need! We can use the **short int**
primitive, which will cut this range down to between -32,767 and 32,767.
(Anyone who purposely mismatches cards for 32K turns deserves to get whatever score
the want.) On most computer systems, short ints (or more colloquially, **shorts**)
use less memory than ints because they represent a _shorter_ range. (Get it?)
For those computers, we've saved a bit of memory. Nice!

While we're at it, isn't it weird that we reserve so much space for negative values
when this game really doesn't make much use of them? None of our shorts make
sense as negatives, so why don't we turn them into **unsigned** shorts? This will
convert our range to between 0 and 65,535.

There is a caveat with using _unsigned_ values, whose full reasoning goes beyond
the scope of this course. The main idea is that if you happen to get a negative value,
like the following:

```c++
unsigned short int val = -1; // range: 0 to 65,535
```

C++ will **wrap around** and set `val` to 65,535. You can imagine this as a number
circle, where 65,535 is right next to 0. If you go one step past 0 (i.e. -1), you
will get to 65,535. Similarly, -2 results in 65,534 and so on.

In light of this, you need to be very careful negative numbers can't "leak" into
your program. In our case, it's possible that future programmers might decide to
open up the x-y plane into negative numbers. Imagine how confused they'd be if
they suddenly get giant positive values! For this reason, it's generally not
recommended to use unsigned variables, even if they can make our program nicer.

**Task**: Change your integers to be shorts. You can optionally set them to be unsigned
depending on how risk-tolerant you are 😉
