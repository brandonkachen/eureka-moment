# Game Infrastructure

We're going to implement a simple, popular card game called "Concentration".
It has other names, like "Match Match" or "Memory". See
[here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)>)
for a quick explanation/refresher on how the game works, and
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=492bM_dhdR4) for a video
describing the same game. Note: for simplicity, our version will be
single-player, where the player will try to beat a top score.

## Task 1: Creating our deck

We're going to simulate a standard deck of cards (4 suits, Ace to King, no Jokers).
There are many ways to represent the different cards. Because the most complex operation
we're going to make with these cards is comparing them for equality, we will keep things
simple and use strings to represent them.

<BlankComp qid="auv3" answers={{ e: "order", j: "array" }} {...props}>
  We now need to decide how the deck should work. Decks allow us to `____`[e]
  the cards, so one follows another. This allows us to flip through so we can
  shuffle or deal out the cards. We'll use an `____`[j] to represent the deck in
  our program.
</BlankComp>

To represent our cards, we will append the card value with the suit.
For the card values, we'll use A, J, Q, and K for ace, jack, queen, and king respectively;
1-10 for the rest. For the suit, we'll use D, C, H, S to represent
diamond, club, heart, and spade respectively. Here are some example values:

- `2C`: 1 of Clubs
- `QH`: Queen of Hearts
- `AS`: Ace of Spades.

**Task:** Create a deck that contains all 52 cards.

## Task 2: Set up the gameboard

This game requires spreading out all the cards in a grid, so the player can see
all of them at once. Our array that represents the deck isn't a great choice,
becuase arrays are only good at storing **contiguous** data, or data that is ordered
from beginning to end with no missing pieces anywhere.

This isn't ideal because we need multiple rows to represent the cards. We could keep
track of the index and which row this would correspond with, but that is a bit complicated.
Instead, can't we just have multiple arrays of cards?
Kind of like mini-decks that are all laid out one after another?

Definitely! Let's go ahead and create a few arrays to store the cards, then
loop through each of them to display each row. Let's start small, so we
can more easily catch any bugs in our code before we have too many arrays.

**Task:** Create 4 arrays that hold 3 random cards each, then output them face-up
to the console in order so they represent a game board. Your output should look
like this (but your card values may differ):

```
JC KH 2C
AD 3S QH
7C 10H QS
3H 9S 6D
```

## Task 3: Simplify the gameboard representation

Our arrays are nice, but they can be a bit difficult to manage, especially
if we want to allow the number of cards to be determined by the user at run-time.
Wouldn't it be better if we just had one entity to interact with, like a "super"
array that manages all these arrays?

Well fortuantely, we do have such a tool and it's called a **two-dimensional** array.
It is an array of arrays. That probably sounds a bit confusing, but
you can think of them as a more elegant form of what we did in the previous task:
set up a bunch of arrays and access them. The only difference here is that we store our
arrays inside of a single array, rather than as separate variables. This implies
that our result is a grid, which is exactly what we want in this game.

The syntax for a 2D (integer) array is:

```
int two_d[10][20]; // 10 individual arrays, each size 20 ints.
```

Printing this is a little more challenging than in the previous task, as the
arrays are not just stored in a variable you can directly call. What might
you have to do instead?

**Task**: Re-create the gameboard using a 2D array of type string called `gameBoard`
and print its values. Your output should remain identical to that of the previous task.

## Task 4: Cleanup

### Global variables

In the future, we may allow the user to set the size of the game board when they
start the game. We won't do that task right now because it'll be a fair amount
of work and doesn't advance us forward. For now, we're happy to manually set it
and re-compile the program.

But we make our lives easier by setting the game board size in global variables
that we can reference anywhere in our program. You can find more information
and syntax in `level1`. We should add a global variable that stores the size
our rows, and another for the size of each column.

### Invalid game boards

We should note that not all 2D arrays will result in valid game configurations
for us. For example, a 3x3 grid would result in a card with no pair. In this case,
our program should terminate immediately with the following message:

```
Game was not configured in a valid state.
```

How can we check the array to ensure the `gameBoard` configuration is valid?

### Sidenote

While we're here talking about 2D arrays, we should note that we aren't limited to just
two dimensions. Three dimensional arrays are common as well, which are represented as cubes
or rectangular cuboids. There aren't many practical uses to more than 2 or 3 dimensions,
and the computer memory required increases exponentially as you add more dimensions. We
use the term **multi-dimensional arrays** to encapsulate all these types of arrays.

**Task**: Add two global variables, `GAME_ROWS` and `GAME_COLS`, to set the gameBoard's
rows and columns, respectively. Additionally, add the check described above to ensure
the `gameBoard` configuration is valid at runtime.

# Gameplay

Now let's let the user play! We need to implement:

- card state (so the user doesn't see what the card is)
- user input (so the user can match the cards)
- game loop (to advance to the next round)
- player turn counter (to show how many turns the user has taken thus far)
- number of pairs left to match and number of pairs matched (to show player progress)

We'll tackle these in the order presented, because each feature that we implement
will help with the subsequent one.

## Task 5: Card state

Each card can be in 3 different states at any given time:

1. showing (faced up so the user can see the card value and suit)
2. hiding (faced upside down)
3. removed from gameplay

#1 is pretty self-explanatory. It looks like this, for Jack of hearts:

```
JH
```

#2 will look like this:

```
(0,0)
```

where the numbers inside represent the location on the board, like a coordinate plane.
Since the gameboard can be quite large (infinitely large, since it's all virtual!),
we need to make it super easy for the user to point out one card from another
Initially, a 3x3 game will look like this:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)
```

The easiest way to imagine this is to think of the x-y plane, where x grows to the right
and y grows downward.

#3 will look like this:

```
()
```

This occurs when the user selects a matching pair. At that point, we want to remove
the card from gameplay but show the user that it was removed. At the end of a successful
3x3 game, the result will be:

```
() () ()
() () ()
() () ()
() () ()
```

How do we control when a card goes into each state? To make our lives easier, let's create
a separate 2D array that shows the state of the current _game_. In other words, this new
array won't hold any information on the card values themselves, but rather keep track of
what to display to the user at any given time based on the game staet.

**Task**: Implement a 2D array of type int called `gameState` that assigns a state to each card.
The valid values are 1, 2, or 3, depending on the corresponding state explained above.
Then to test your array, loop through `gameState` and print out what the user should see.

## Task 6: User Input

Unfortunately, allowing the user to click on the card itself is beyond
the scope of this course so our solution will need to be a little clunkier.

Since we know how to read in the user input via `std::cin`, let's have them
pass in pairs of coordinates that inform us of the cards they want to flip over.

For example, in a 3x3 game, we output the following at the beginning:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

The user must then respond with a coordinate like this (with parentheses):

```
(0,2)
```

Next, we'll output:

```
(0,0) (0,1) 4S
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the second card:
```

When the user enters this second coordinate, we need to edit the `gameState`
board. First, check the `gameBoard` array for a match between these coordinates.
If there is a match, edit your `gameState` array to set _both_ cards to state #3.
Otherwise, set both cards back to state #2.

**Task**: Implement the above example. Make sure to change the state of your
`gameState` array so it displays the proper view to the user at any given time.

## Task 7: Game loop

Now, let's put in the basics for the full gameplay. This may sound daunting,
but it's actually quite simple.

Let's step back for a second. If we've already got one turn down, what do we
need to do to ensure we continue to the next turn? Well, we've already got our
`gameBoard` and `gameState` arrays set up for the next turn so those don't need
to change. Neither does the view we present to the player, because that is only
dependent on the previous two arrays.

<BlankComp qid="bri9" answers={{ e: "run", k: "forever" }} {...props}>
  Seems like we just need to `____`[e] the same code above again. We don't just
  want to do this once, though, right? After all, this game could last `____`[k]
  (poor player!) if the player doesn't match any pairs.
</BlankComp>

This means we need an infinite loop. Typically those are bad because it means your
program is spinning out of control, but in this case, we are keeping tight control
over it so we're ok. You can create an infinite loop in many ways; the key criteria
is that the evaluation condition is never satisfied.

Of course, we eventually need to terminate this loop if the user completes the game.
To do this, we can add a simple `break;` statement when the winning conditions are met.
We will do this in the later steps. For now, just exit out of the program when you test
or write an arbitrary condition to `break` out of the infinite loop yourself.

**Task**: Create two infinite loops, with different evaluation conditions. Comment
one out and apply the other to the code you wrote in the previous task.

## Task 8: Player turn counter

Now that we have a functional game, we want to keep track of some metrics. Our first
metric is the number of turns the player has taken. This is basically the player's score;
the lower the more impressive. A turn is complete when we've taken two inputs from the user
and checked against `gameBoard`.

At any point in the game, the user should see the number of turns taken.
It should look like this:

```
Turns taken: 8

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

At the end of the game, output the following statement:

```
Congratulations, you've completed the game!
You took x turns in total.
```

where `x` will tell the user how many turns they took.

**Task**: Add an integer called `playerTurns` to count the number of turns the player
has taken and the end-of-game outputdescribed above.

## Task 9: Pairs matched and left to match

To help the player easily gauge how far into the game they've reached, we need to
tell them how many pairs they've matched and how many they have left to match.
At any point in the game, the user should see these two counts. It should look like this:

```
Turns taken: 8. Pairs matched: 2. Pairs remaining: 4.

(0,0) () (0,2)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)
() (2,1) ()
(3,0) (3,1) ()

Enter a coordinate for the first card:
```

<BlankComp qid="csq8" answers={{ d: "calculate" }} {...props}>
  Let's use a simple variable to track the number of pairs matched. We'll update
  it every time the player makes a match Note: we won't explicitly track the
  pairs left because we can `____`[d] that from the pairs matched.
</BlankComp>

(Bonus: what is another way we can accomplish this task?)

**Task**: Add an integer called `pairsMatched` to track the number of pairs matched
by the user. Add text to show the number of pairs matched and left to match, as shown
in the example above.

## Task 10: Refactor

Why mess with a working program? Sometimes we need to **refactor** it, or change the code
without changing the functionality. This is an opportunity to organize the code in a better way,
for yourself and future developers. In our case, the program is fairly simple but can benefit
from abstracting some of the details into functions. Let's start with displaying the grid.

Here's some initial code to get you started with this function:

```c++
// put this code outside the main() function
void display(int (*arr)[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS]) {
  // you can access the array like you normally
  // would, e.g. arr[0][0]
}
```

Later, when you call it, you'll need to add in an extra operator denoted with the `&` symbol:

```c++
int main() {
  // somewhere in the code
  display(&gameState);
}
```

**Task**: Create a void function outside of `int main()` called `display` that
takes in a parameter called `arr` that represents the game board and prints out
the state of the game to the console. Then, have your program call it whenever
it needs to display the game state. The game's functionality should not change.

## Task 11: Pointers

Did you notice the `*` in the `arr` parameter? That's not a typo; it's a C++ **pointer**.
This is one of the coolest, most dangerous, and most unique ideas of C and C++.
Let's tread carefully.

Pointers "point" to your data by acting as little flags for a piece of data that you
can get back to later. Think of them as tiny maps or breadcrumbs but for your program;
when you have a pointer, you can "follow" it to get to the underlying piece of memory
and read those values. Following a pointer is often called **dereferencing** it.

That means in our code above, we weren't really copying the entire array into the `display`
function when we passed it as a variable. We were actually copying the pointer value,
which takes up considerably less memory. When we access a specific index in the `arr` variable
inside `display`, we dereference the pointer and get to the array value underneath.

This has huge implications. Pointers are one of the key reasons for C and C++'s
legendary speed because they're used _everywhere_. Now, we can reach any object of any size
just as quickly as we can reach as an int!

<!--
How does the magic work? Well, pointer _values_ are actually just memory addresses
that look like `0x78f4eeaf3fa0` when print it out. The memory addresses tell
C++ what part of memory we want to access. When C++ goes to that part of memory, it finds
the value stored there and retrieves it. -->

**Task**: Print out the pointer value . Remember, when you use

Alas, this capability is a double-edged sword. While it unlocks high performance, this comes
at the cost of potential instability. For the sake of speed (remember: a cornerstone of C and C++),
C++ won't check pointers for validity before following them. If we're not careful, pointers
could lead us to incorrect values or worse, null values. If you try to access a pointer to a null
object, your program will experience **undefined behavior**. This means the C++ standard doesn't
explicitly define what the program should do, so it's up to your compiler. A nice compiler
will

In our maps/breadcrumbs analogy, if we're not careful, pointers could lead us to a witch's cottage. 😬

## Task 12: New primitives

The code above is great, but while we're here, let's make a few easy changes to
make our program a bit lighter on memory and sensible. For one thing, we don't
reasonably expect the game to contain a huge number of player turns, pairs matched,
or pairs left to match. Our card coordinates also shouldn't exceed a huge number.

Well, the `int` primitive we've been using can store values between -2,147,483,648
and 2,147,483,647. That's way more than we need! We can use the **short int**
primitive, which will cut this range down to between -32,767 and 32,767.
(Anyone who purposely mismatches cards for 32K turns deserves to get whatever score
the want.) On most computer systems, short ints (or more colloquially, **shorts**)
use less memory than ints because they represent a _shorter_ range. (Get it?)
For those computers, we've saved a bit of memory. Nice!

While we're at it, isn't it weird that we reserve so much space for negative values
when this game really doesn't make much use of them? None of our shorts make
sense as negatives, so why don't we turn them into **unsigned** shorts? This will
convert our range to between 0 and 65,535.

There is a caveat with using _unsigned_ values, whose full reasoning goes beyond
the scope of this course. The main idea is that if you happen to get a negative value,
like the following:

```c++
unsigned short int val = -1; // range: 0 to 65,535
```

C++ will **wrap around** and set `val` to 65,535. You can imagine this as a number
circle, where 65,535 is right next to 0. If you go one step past 0 (i.e. -1), you
will get to 65,535. Similarly, -2 results in 65,534 and so on.

In light of this, you need to be very careful negative numbers can't "leak" into
your program. In our case, it's possible that future programmers might decide to
open up the x-y plane into negative numbers. Imagine how confused they'd be if
they suddenly get giant positive values! For this reason, it's generally not
recommended to use unsigned variables, even if they can make our program nicer.

**Task**: Change your integers to be shorts. You can optionally set them to be unsigned
depending on how risk-tolerant you are 😉
