## Task 1: Create an item

Items have a few attributes:

- name (string)
- description (string)
- effect (string)
- rarity (int)

Let's go ahead and create these attributes to describe one item.
Its name will be "health_potion", description will be "heals the player 10 points",
effect will be "+ 10 hp", and rarity will be "2".

Fill out the blanks for Task 1 in `main.cpp`. We now have a health potion item!

## Task 2: Create some more items

Ok, great. Let's create 3 more health items. We'll prefix them with `item2` and `item3`.

## Task 3: Adding a new attribute

Ok, sorry you had to go through that. Kind of painful, isn't it?
Well I've got some more bad news for you, the bossman wants us to
add a new attribute to each item: "timer". This is an `int` that determines
how many turns the player can hold this item for.
Once elapsed, it will destroy the object.

Go back to each item you've created in the previous tasks and
add a "timer" attribute with a value of 3.

## Task 4: A better way

This... isn't a very scalable solution, is it? We've barely created 3 health potions
and yet we've written nearly the same code 3 times! What's worse, adding a new
attribute to them means we need to add a new line of code for each item.

The worst part is that in this program, the number of lines of code
will grow _linearly_ to the number of items we create. That will be a nightmare
to maintain, and typos galore!

No, there has to be a better way... introducing C++ structs! (Betcha didn't see that coming.)

Structs allow us to repackage functionality that should belong to some objects (in this case,
our items) and easily create multiple copies of them. Here's the basic syntax:

```cpp
Struct NameOfStruct {
  public:
    int attribute1 = 1;
    std::string attribute2 = "test";
    std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";
};
```

The above code defined a struct called `NameOfStruct`. It has three _members_:

1. attribute1 of type `int`
2. attribute2 of type `string`
3. attribute3 of type `string`

Create a `struct` of type `HealthPotion`. Add the attributes described in Task 1 as members.

## Task 5: Creating an instance

Now, let's use this struct. We can call it with the same syntax as any of our fundamental types.
Using the sample above, I can write:

```cpp
NameOfStruct obj;
```

Simple, nice! I can access its members like this:

```cpp
obj.attribute1; // calls this member, but does nothing with it

std::cout << obj.attribute2 << std::endl; // prints: "test"
```

Note that we were only able to do this by

Create a `HealthPotion` object, called hp1 and print out its "name" member.

## Task 6: Creating 100 HealthPotions _easily_

This is great! Now we can create a bunch of HealhPotion objects and store them
in an array, just like we'd do for other objects. Now, if we wanted to
create 1,000 health potions instead, it's as simple as changing one variable.
Just like our fundamental types, we can simply declare an array of our struct type:

```cpp
NameOfStruct struct_array[10];

// Notice the how similar this looks to the following:
int int_array[10];
```

Create an array of 100 health potions. Then, change your code to create and hold 1000 health potions.

## Task 7: Constructors

What if some attributes are different between health potions? For example, some health
potions should heal you more while others heal you less. Why can't we just change
the value in the struct itself? (answer_req)

At first glance, this looks impossible. Fortunately, the designers of C++ have a solution:
_constructors_. This is a special function (or "method") that lives in structes and is responsible
for setting it up. Here's the syntax:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";

  // Constructor
  NameOfStruct(int att1) {
    attribute1 = att1;
  }
};
```

Notice that its name is equivalent to the _struct_ name. This is our telltale sign that
the method is a constructor. It also takes in an argument, like any function.
Then, it will set the `attribute1` member to the argument it was passed, `att1`.
Also notice that the constructor was declared last. Why is it done that way? (answer_req)

Now, when we create this object, we'll have to pass in an argument:

```cpp
NameOfStruct obj(10); // 10 is sent to `att1` argument
std::cout << obj.attribute1 << std::endl; // prints: 10
```

Let's add a constructor for `HealthPotion` that lets you set the `effect`.
Don't forget to update all your `HealthPotion` objects so they
pass in an argument for the `effect` member.

## Task 8: Initial timer functionality

Let's implement the timer's functionality. To do so, we'll need to know how many
turns have elapsed since the player has acquired the timer. In the repl, you'll
see some unfinished code with a `turn` variable simulating turns passing by. This will
tell us how many turns have passed.

Add some code to decrement `hp`'s timer. When it hits 0, output "Health Potion has expired."

## Task 9: Destructors

Unfortunately, our `HealthPotion` object is still alive and kicking, even after
it was expired. We need to delete it from the program's memory. C++ gives us this ability
through an _operator_. Operators are keywords that are built into C++ that give us specific
functionality. In this case, we can use the "delete" operator like this:

```cpp
delete obj;
```

When C++ runs this line of code, it actually calls `obj`'s _destructor_. This is another
special method that exists in every class, like the constructor. It is responsible
for handling deletion events you want your object to perform when it is deleted.
Here's the syntax for the destructor:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";

  // Constructor
  NameOfStruct(int att1) {
    attribute1 = att1;
  }

  // Destructor
  ~NameOfStruct() {
    std::cout << "nooo i'm going awayyy" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "i can still access my attributes; "
              << "attribute1: " << attribute1;
  }
};
```

How is the destructor similar and different from the constructor? (answer_req)
Notice that the destructor doesn't take in any arguments, as it only handles the
object itself. It can still access all the members within itself.

This is a great place for us to output the expired health potion's message
that you printed in the previous task. Let's move it to the destructor and add
a call to `delete` the object when the timer ends.

## Task 10: Public and Private Members

You know, using the `HealthPotion` struct still requires a lot of knowledge about how it works.
For example, as a programmer, you have to manually decrement the timer every single turn. You also
need to see how many turns are left and check that after it reaches 0, the timer is deleted.
Wouldn't it be great to not worry about that? Is there a way to set up our `HealthPotion` struct
so that when the player picks one up, it'll just automatically disappear after 3 turns?

Fortunately, _private_ members can help us accomplish this! By default, struct members are
_public_. This means they can be accessed outside of the struct. In other words, they're
publicly available to the rest of the program. This is why the `main()` function was able to get
and set members in the previous tasks, like the timer value or the "effect" attribute.
Private members are the opposite; they can **only** be accessed by members in
their own struct.

How can this help us hide implementation details? (answer_req)

---

Let's add a new member, this time a function called "cleanup". Its job is to decrement
the timer and see if 3 turns have elapsed. If so, it will destroy the object.
Note: since we're now deleting the object _from within_ the struct code,
we need to use the syntax `delete this;` instead of the object name.
`this` is a C++ keyword that represents the object itself.

Now, when we loop through the turns, the programmer can simply call the `cleanup` function
every turn. The programmer doesn't need to know what `cleanup` does, just that in order
to properly use this class, they must follow our rule. In fact, they don't need to know
there's a timer at all. We can now make the timer a _private_ member, so other parts of the
program don't see it at all. Here's an example of the syntax:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  int attribute1 = 1;
  std::string attribute2 = "test";
  std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";
  std::string cleanup() {
    return priv_att; // can still access private members.
  }

  private:
    std::string priv_att = "this string is private";
```

In fact, just to be explicit, we can add the "public" keyword for the other members:

```cpp
struct NameOfStruct {
  public:
    int attribute1 = 1;
    std::string attribute2 = "test";
    std::string attribute3 = "related to attribute 3";
    std::string cleanup() {
      return priv_att; // can still access private members.
    }

  private:
    std::string priv_att = "this string is private";
```

As your programs get more complex, private struct members may be useful to
"hide" some of the functionality from the rest of your code.
This will help simplify what other programmers need to know
in order to use your structs.

## Task 11: Putting it all Together

Implement the following:

1. Create a new `HealthPotion` array that can hold up to 10 at a time.
2. Add 2 potions to it.
3. Take one turn.
4. Add another potion.
5. Take another turn.
6. Add 5 potions.
7. Take another turn. The first two potions should have expired.
8. Take another turn. The third potion should have expired.
9. Take another turn. All the other potions should have expired.

See how easy it is to keep track of all these objects and their attributes?
That's the power of structs!
