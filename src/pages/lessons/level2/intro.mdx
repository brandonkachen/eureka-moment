This level will dig into the complexities of C and C++.
By the end, you should have a clear understanding of the
major differences between these two languages, an intuition for
C++'s hallmark feature and Achilles heel, and overall familiarity
with how C++ really works.

## Lesson Goals

### Work

- Multi-dimensional arrays
- C vs C++ (code-level)
- Pointers and References
- Uncommon Primatives

### Fun

- Implement Concentration card game

# Instructions

On the next screen, you'll find instructions and explanations
on the left-hand panel as you build your program.
It is scrollable, so make sure you get to the bottom before continuing on.
The right-hand panel contains your coding environment
(a "[repl](https://docs.repl.it/)").
You can hit the "run" button at the top right to compile and run your program.
