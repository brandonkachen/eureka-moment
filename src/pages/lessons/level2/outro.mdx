# Summary

This level introduced us to multi-dimensional arrays, controlled infinite loops,
pointers, and new primitives. But the more important thing: we built a game from scratch!
Not hard to see us rewriting this for an app, slapping a \$1.99 label on it,
and making ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° on the App Store! Just kidding, but congrats on building your
first C++ game from scratch. ðŸŽ‰

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What are pointers, and why are they useful?

<FreeRespComp qid="vaj0" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

2. List all the high-level steps that C++ takes when you access an item from a 2D array.
   You can write them out using C++ code or just list the steps, but be specific.

<FreeRespComp qid="wqu9" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

3. Why did we use the `short` primitive type in the game? What does it give us?
   If you used `unsigned` as well, why was the risk worth it? If not, why not?

<FreeRespComp qid="xaf4" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

# Challenge

1. In this level, we used strings to represent our cards, e.g "Ace of Hearts", because we
   only needed to compare them for equality. What if we changed the rules so a player can
   take away a pair of cards _only if_ the first one flipped was less than the second one in value
   (Ace, Jack, Queen, King = 1, 11, 12, 13 respectively)? In other words, if first_card â‰¥ second_card,
   you can't take them out. How would this make our chosen format to represent the cards harder to
   write code for? What can we do instead, to make our lives easier?

2. The following is an alternative version of the `display(...)` function. Note the explicit use of pointers and references.
   If you replaced your code with this alternative, would your program compile and perform identically to your current version?
   Why or why not? Don't run this code, just reason through it and explain your thinking.

```c++
 void display(
  int (*gb)[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS],
  int (*gs)[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS]) {
     // code to display board
 }

 int main() {
   // somewhere in the program
  display(&gameBoard, &gameState);
 }
```

# Feature Requests

You don't need to implement these ideas, but if you have some spare time/energy, feel free
to come back to this section and work on some of these ideas. Even just _thinking_ about how
you might implement some of these features would help you grow your C++ skills!

1. A shuffle feature to make this game more replay-able.
2. A leaderboard, based on the fewest number of moves for a grid size
3. Multi-player support
