# Summary

This level introduced us to multi-dimensional arrays, the "new" and "delete"
syntax, and desirable infinite loops.

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1.

# Challenge

1. In this level, we used strings to represent our cards, e.g "Ace of Hearts", because we
   only needed to compare for equality. If we wanted to modify the game such that you can
   take away a pair of cards _only if_ the first one flipped was less than the second one in value
   (Ace, Jack, Queen, King = 1, 11, 12, 13 respectively), how would this format for cards make
   the code harder to write? What can we do instead, to make our lives easier?

2. Add a shuffle feature to make this game more replay-able.
