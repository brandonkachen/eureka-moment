# Summary

This level introduced us to some advanced features of C++. We learned about:

- multi-dimensional arrays,
- controlled infinite loops,
- pointers and references
- uncommon primitive types.

But the more important thing: we made the Concentration card game from scratch! ðŸŽ‰

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What are pointers, and why are they useful?

<FreeRespComp qid="vaj0" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

2. List all the high-level steps that C++ takes when you access an item in a 2D array.
   You can write them out using C++ code or just list the steps, but be specific.

<FreeRespComp qid="wqu9" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

3. Why did we use the `short` primitive type in the game? What does it give us?
   If you used `unsigned` as well, why was the risk worth it? If not, why not?

<FreeRespComp qid="xaf4" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

# Challenge Questions

1. In this level, we used strings to represent our cards (e.g "AH" for Ace of Hearts)
   because we only needed to compare them for equality. What if we changed the rules
   so a player can take away a pair of cards _only if_ the first one flipped was less
   than the second one in value (Ace, Jack, Queen, King = 1, 11, 12, 13 respectively)?
   In other words, if first_card â‰¥ second_card, you cannot take them out.
   How would our card format make this functionality harder to implement?
   What would be an alternative, more flexible card format?

<FreeRespComp qid="xws8" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

2. The following code snippet is an alternative version of the `display(...)` function.
   Note the explicit use of pointers and references. If you replaced your code with this
   alternative, would your program compile and perform identically to your current version?
   Why or why not? Don't run this code, just reason through it and explain your thinking.

```c++
 void display(
  int (*gb)[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS],
  int (*gs)[GAME_ROWS][GAME_COLS]) {
     // code to display board
 }

 int main() {
   // somewhere in the program
  display(&gameBoard, &gameState);
 }
```

<FreeRespComp qid="ydv8" {...props}></FreeRespComp>

# Feature Requests

You don't need to implement these ideas, but if you have some spare time/energy, feel free
to come back to this section and work on some of these ideas. Even just _thinking_ about how
you might implement some of these features will help improve your C++ skills!

1. A "replay" feature to restart the game.
2. A shuffle feature to make this game more fun to replay.
3. A leaderboard, based on the fewest number of moves for a grid size
4. Multi-player support
