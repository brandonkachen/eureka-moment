# Level 0: Welcome! 👋

Glad you're here, we've got a lot of interesting ideas to talk
about!

Today's plan is to build up your intuition for programming
and what's really going on underneath the hood of a computer.
Since we'll be using a programming language called **C++**, it's only
fair that you know _why_. But we'll try help you _discover_ why, rather
than just throw some facts at you.

At the end of this lesson, you should have a good sense for
what C++ is used for in modern-day applications and why we're
choosing to use it to teach you the fundamentals of programming.
Let's dive right in! 🌊🏄

## Lesson Goals

### Work

- Learn why C++ exists/is still around
- See What C++ is used for
- Reason about C++'s quirks.

### Fun

- Dig into the "philosophy of language" a bit
