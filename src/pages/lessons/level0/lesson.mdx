# Language Philosophy

Let's talk about some fundamental questions around coding. Sorry
in advance if this gets too philosphical.

## What is a program?

<BlankComp>
  `___` that is formatted in a way that allows computers to draw meaning and
  `___` tasks.
</BlankComp>

## What is a programming language?

<BlankComp>
  A set of `___`, words, and grammar to communicate `___` to a computer, so it
  can perform actions for you.
</BlankComp>

## Why do programmers call them "languages"?

(Hint: What makes them similar to real, _cultural_ languages like English?)

A: They express ideas and methods for accomplishing tasks. If
you're fluent in a language, you can use it to properly
communicate with someone else who is also fluent.

## What makes a language useful?

(Hint: what makes any kind of language useful?)

A: Being able to express your ideas so someone else understands
them. Talking and {thinking} more {concretely} about abstract ideas.

## Interesting story about language...

Let me tell you an interesting story about cultural languages:

For centuries, people had assumed that all humans thought of
"stuff" in the same way regardless of their cultural background
or language. That is, humans perceive the same things, just
under different labels depending where you lived. That makes
sense, right? After all, the sun is
the-giant-bright-round-thing-in-the-sky, whether you spoke
Spanish or Korean. While this is a sensible assumption, it's not
exactly true. It turns out that over time, different cultures
have evolved to highlight certain phenomena over others.

For example, the Greek has different words for light blue ("ghalazio") and dark
blue ("ble"). In English, we don't have this distinction, simply calling both
hues "blue". Researchers have conducted neuroscientific studies on Greek and
English native speakers, and have found that Greek speakers' brains tended to
behave differently from English speakers' brains when seeing light blue and dark
blue. They often didn't even notice this distinction, leading the researchers to
conclude the distinction was made unconsciously. This means that by virtue of
their language, Greek speakers (at least subconsciously) tend to perceive color
in slightly different ways from English speakers.

In summary, language emphasizes and demphasizes certain aspects of reality,
which influences us to be more or less sensitive to them. A quick note: this
does not mean that some humans are unable to perceive some aspects of reality,
just that they are influenced to notice them more or less often depending on
their culture and language. (By the way, this kind of language analysis is
covered by a field called _linguistics_.)

## How might the idea above apply to _programming_ languages?

A: Some languages are {good} for some kinds of tasks, others for
other tasks.

## So... what does all this mean?

Knowing a bit about the {background} and culture of a programming {language}
can help us better understand why it {works} the way it does! In turn, this
can make it easier to pick up on C++'s quirks and better avoid its pitfalls.

# C++ Historical Context

The first thing to know about **C++** is that it's actually an
offshoot of another language, called **C**. Specifically, C++ is a _superset_ of C.

## What does that mean?

A: C++ does {everything} C can do and more. That means any program written in C is also
compatible with C++ (but not necessarily vice versa).

## Well, what's C then?

C is a programming language designed to be **portable**
without sacrificing speed or **low-level** functionality.

## What does "portable" mean in this context?

A: Portable means it could run in {any} computer environment,
regardless of the underlying {hardware} like computer chips or
RAM. This was not true of many languages at the time, so it was
a very important feature for people who wanted to develop
software on their own computers but {share} it with people using
other kinds computers.

## What is "low-level functionality"?

A: Low-level functionality means you had very strong programatic control
over the computer chip and RAM, which operate at the lowest, most concrete level.
It gave you a lot of {flexibility} in your code, because you could manipulate
the actual hardware {directly} but came at the tradeoff of requiring a
lot more technical {knowledge} to operate.

## Why was it important to be fast?

A: At the time, computers were super {slow}. Any software optimization you could
perform to reduce the number of operations required to run programs would be highly valuable.
C/C++'s speed became a huge driver of its popularity in this time period.

Sidenote: Did you know that our modern cell phones have more computational power
than NASA's supercomputers had when we sent astronauts to the moon in 1969?
If you were curious about _why_, here's a great
[resource](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/210872-extremetech-explains-what-is-moores-law))
explaining one of the primary reasons for this drastic change, Moore's law.

## Aren't computers fast enough _nowadays_?

If your software can perform faster, then you can get away
with a slower processor in order to accomplish a task.
This means you can take advantage of {cheaper} hardware.
At the very least, it means your program will continue to be usable for
longer without major changes, leading to better {future}-proofing.

## C++ brought the idea of **classes** to the mix. What are classes?

A: Pieces of code that can {easily} be configured and
{reconfigured}, depending on what they're needed for. Programmers
have given this idea a fancy name: "object-oriented
programming". Fun fact: C++ was initially called "C with Classes" for this reason.

## What's so special about classes?

A: It let them find {patterns} in their programs, so they could
re-use pieces of code to describe them. It also allowed them to
hide implementation {details} in parts of their program, so they
didn't have to deal with every detail of a piece of {code} just to
use it. This idea is called **abstraction**.

(Sidenote: remember when we were talking about how language can affect
thinking? Well this was one programmers really liked to use for
their thinking!)

## Today, there are hundreds of different computer languages. Is C++ still relevant?

A: Speed and flexibility are always valuable. C++ has also had a
lot of time to {mature} and for people to build {communities} around
it to improve and learn how to use it. And some of its ideas, like classes,
are still {fundamental} to modern day programming. Proof in the pudding:
C and C++ are still in the top 10 most popular languages list in 2020
([source](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/programming-languages-ranking)).

## OK, but why should I use C++ to learn fundamental programming skills?

A: In your author's humble opinion, C++ is uniquely equipped to
give you enough {high}-level programming {patterns} and {abstractions}
while being {low}-level enough that you get a feel for what is
really happening when you run a program. You'll gain a useful
jumping-off point for tackling other languages in the future
because most of them will still use the idea of classes, but
you'll still be able to trace through the logic of what's really
going on in a computer.
