# Language Philosophy

Let's talk about some fundamental questions around coding. Sorry
in advance if this gets too philosphical.

## What is a program?

<BlankComp answers={{ e: "Information", k: "perform" }} qid="aes7" {...props}>
  A: `____`[e] that is formatted in a way that allows computers to draw meaning
  and `____`[k] tasks for us.
</BlankComp>

## What is a programming language?

<BlankComp answers={{ g: "characters", x: "meaning" }} qid="bhf4" {...props}>
  A: A set of `____`[g], words, and grammar to communicate `____`[x] to a
  computer, so it can perform actions for you.
</BlankComp>

## Why do programmers call them "languages"?

(Hint: What makes them similar to real, _cultural_ languages like English?)

<BlankComp answers={{ d: "ideas" }} qid="cwi9" {...props}>
  A: They express `____`[d] and methods for accomplishing tasks. If you're
  fluent in a language, you can use it to properly communicate with someone else
  who is also fluent.
</BlankComp>

## What makes a language useful?

(Hint: what makes any kind of language useful?)

<BlankComp answers={{ c: "thinking", j: "concretely" }} qid="dwk3" {...props}>
  A: Being able to express your ideas so someone else understands them. Talking
  and `____`[c] more `____`[j] about abstract ideas.
</BlankComp>

## Interesting story about language...

Let me tell you an interesting story about cultural languages:

For centuries, people had assumed that all humans thought of
"stuff" in the same way regardless of their cultural background
or language. That is, humans perceive the same things, just
under different labels depending where you lived. That makes
sense, right? After all, the sun is
the-giant-bright-round-thing-in-the-sky, whether you spoke
Spanish or Korean. While this is a sensible assumption, it's not
exactly true. It turns out that over time, different cultures
have evolved to highlight certain phenomena over others.

For example, the Greek has different words for light blue ("ghalazio") and dark
blue ("ble"). In English, we don't have this distinction, simply calling both
hues "blue". Researchers have conducted neuroscientific studies on Greek and
English native speakers, and have found that Greek speakers' brains tended to
behave differently from English speakers' brains when seeing light blue and dark
blue. They often didn't even notice this distinction, leading the researchers to
conclude the distinction was made unconsciously. This means that by virtue of
their language, Greek speakers (at least subconsciously) tend to perceive color
in slightly different ways from English speakers.

In summary, language emphasizes and demphasizes certain aspects of reality,
which influences us to be more or less sensitive to them. A quick note: this
does not mean that some humans are unable to perceive some aspects of reality,
just that they are influenced to notice them more or less often depending on
their culture and language. (By the way, this kind of language analysis is
covered by a field called _linguistics_.)

## How might the ideas above apply to _programming_ languages?

<BlankComp answers={{ d: "good" }} qid="dzi8" {...props}>
  A: Some languages are `____`[d] for some kinds of tasks, others for other
  tasks.
</BlankComp>

## So... what does all this mean?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ c: "background", k: "language", o: "works" }}
  qid="ene5"
  {...props}
>
  A: Knowing a bit about the `____`[c] and culture of a programming `____`[k]
  can help us better understand why it `____`[o] the way it does! In turn, this
  can make it easier to pick up on C++'s quirks and better avoid its pitfalls.
</BlankComp>

# C++ Historical Context

The first thing to know about **C++** is that it's actually an
offshoot of another language, called **C**. Specifically, C++ is a _superset_ of C.

## What does that mean?

<BlankComp answers={{ d: "everything" }} qid="fii1" {...props}>
  A: C++ does `____`[d] C can do and more. That means any program written in C
  is also compatible with C++ (but not necessarily vice versa).
</BlankComp>

## Well, what's C then?

C is a programming language designed to be **portable**
without sacrificing speed or **low-level** functionality.

## What does "portable" mean in this context?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ b: "any", f: "hardware", l: "share" }}
  qid="fjw3"
  {...props}
>
  A: Portable means it could run in `____`[b] computer environment, regardless
  of the underlying `____`[f] like computer chips or RAM. This was not true of
  many languages at the time, so it was a very important feature for people who
  wanted to develop software on their own computers but `____`[l] it with people
  using other kinds computers.
</BlankComp>

## What is "low-level functionality"?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ c: "flexibility", j: "directly", v: "knowledge" }}
  qid="gan8"
  {...props}
>
  A: Low-level functionality means you had very strong programatic control over
  the computer chip and RAM, which operate at the lowest, most concrete level.
  It gave you a lot of `____`[c] in your code, because you could manipulate the
  actual hardware `____`[j] but came at the tradeoff of requiring a lot more
  technical `____`[v] to operate.
</BlankComp>

## Why was it important to be fast?

<BlankComp answers={{ d: "slow" }} qid="ghj4" {...props}>
  A: At the time, computers were super `____`[d]. Any software optimization you
  could perform to reduce the number of operations required to run programs
  would be highly valuable. C/C++'s speed became a huge driver of its popularity
  in this time period.
</BlankComp>

(Sidenote: Did you know that our modern cell phones have more computational power
than NASA's supercomputers had when we sent astronauts to the moon in 1969? If you
were curious about _why_, here's a great
[resource](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/210872-extremetech-explains-what-is-moores-law))
explaining one of the primary reasons for this drastic change, Moore's law.)

## Aren't computers fast enough _nowadays_?

<BlankComp answers={{ c: "cheaper", j: "future" }} qid="hsr6" {...props}>
  A: If your software can perform faster, then you can get away with a slower
  processor in order to accomplish a task. This means you can take advantage of
  `____`[c] hardware. At the very least, it means your program will continue to
  be usable for longer without major changes, leading to better
  `____`[j]-proofing.
</BlankComp>

## C++ brought the idea of **classes** to the mix. What are classes?

<BlankComp answers={{ e: "easily", l: "reconfigured" }} qid="ibr7" {...props}>
  A: Pieces of code that can `____`[e] be configured and `____`[l], depending on
  what they're needed for. Programmers have given this idea a fancy name:
  "object-oriented programming". Fun fact: C++ was initially called "C with
  Classes" for this reason.
</BlankComp>

## What's so special about classes?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ c: "patterns", i: "details", m: "code" }}
  qid="jvh2"
  {...props}
>
  A: It allowed programmers to find `____`[c] in their programs, so they could
  re-use pieces of code. This meant they didn't have to write the same code over
  and over again, which was difficult to maintain and prone to human error. It
  also allowed them to hide implementation `____`[i] in parts of their program,
  so they didn't have to deal with all aspects of a piece of `____`[m] just to
  use it. This idea is called **abstraction**.
</BlankComp>

(Sidenote: remember when we were talking about how language
can affect thinking? Well this was one programmers really liked to use for
their thinking!)

## Today, there are hundreds of different computer languages. Is C++ still relevant?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ e: "mature", j: "communities", p: "fundamental" }}
  qid="keb4"
  {...props}
>
  A: Speed and flexibility are always valuable. C++ has also had a lot of time
  to `____`[e] and for people to build `____`[j] around it to improve and learn
  how to use it. And some of its ideas, like classes, are still `____`[p] to
  modern day programming. Proof in the pudding: C and C++ are still in the top
  10 most popular languages list in 2020
  ([source](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/programming-languages-ranking)).
</BlankComp>

## OK, but why should I use C++ to learn fundamental programming skills?

<BlankComp
  answers={{ b: "high", g: "patterns", k: "abstractions", n: "low" }}
  qid="lvd6"
  {...props}
>
  A: In your author's humble opinion, C++ is uniquely equipped to give you
  enough `____`[b]-level programming `____`[g] and `____`[k] while being
  `____`[n]-level enough that you get a feel for what is really happening when
  you run a program. You'll gain a useful jumping-off point for tackling other
  languages in the future because most of them will still use the idea of
  classes, but you'll still be able to trace through the logic of what's really
  going on in a computer.
