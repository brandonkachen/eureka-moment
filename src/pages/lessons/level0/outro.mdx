# Summary

In this lesson, we explored the history behind C++. This will help us
make sense of the unique aspects of C++ and avoid its shortcomings.
Here are a few key points from this lesson:

- Programming languages, much like cultural languages, can shape our
  perceptions and thought processes. Choosing the right language for
  your needs will help you build faster.
- C++ was built to be fast, object-oriented (classes), and portable.
- C++ is still widely used today because it gives high performance
  and good code maintainability

# Review

Answer the following questions:

1. What does "portable" mean, when applied to programming languages?
2. What is the major differentiating feature between C and C++,
   and why is that useful?
3. Why does the author think C++ is a good language to use for learning
   the fundamentals of programming?

# Challenge

These are more difficult questions than the previous section.
Spend some time pondering before providing your answer.
You will not be graded on the accuracy of your answer.
Feel free to come _back_ to these challege questions in the future,
as your knowledge increases.

1. What might C++ do _poorly_?
2. C is still a very popular language these days.
   If C++ is a superset, why do people still use C?
